	    <p class="wol">From this website I was inspired to make Home page like that. So I tried to make similar Home page but due to my basic HTML skills I have done only limited things for my home page. To make like this page I asked my friends and teachers for advice and methods. I have also researched in youtube to make Home page and learned their methods. And here is the link to my <a href="Onlinetech.html">Home Page</a></p>
